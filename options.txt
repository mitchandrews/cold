## Virtual IPs & VMs

### redundancy ordering options: ###
#	random				randomize the list before choosing
#	usage-proportional	(default) use sha-1 hashspace algorithm
#
#	%fcfs				first come first server, as listed in options and then appended by arguments
#	%latency			do ping tests or perhaps query previous test results
#	%bandwidth			do throughput tests or perhaps query previous test results
#	%size				do available space checks and start with servers with the most space
redundancy-ordering = usage-proportional


# Notes:
# Create the 'cold' user with its own group (to sandbox cold from the
# rest of the system)
#  useradd -m -G cold cold
#  newgrp - cold
